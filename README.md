# Mitta Screenshot for Google Chrome

Mitta Screenshot is a Google Chrome extension which saves a page to [Mitta.us](https://mitta.us/). The extension takes a screenshot of the current view of the page and then sends it to Mitta, where you can search for it later by title or any text visible on the page when the screenshot was taken.
